User should be prompted with login page upon loading the site
git
If user does not have account present in database, he should be able to input his information, and create one,
which will persist to db. 

User will attempt to login and query db for {user, pass} if response is null, the user or pass is wrong

After the user logs in to the website, they can browse a list of products(books)

The user has the option to add repeated quantities of books to their cart. Each addition should update their cart in the DB.

The user also has the option to "checkout" at any given time, which will flush their current cart from the database


Optional but not necessary actionable items: 
-Reset password functionality if the user has forgotten their password
-Individual profile page for the user 
-Transaction history of the users recent purchases
-User can delete his/her account
-User can filter products list by keyword 
-Various color theme toggling for the website (light/darkmode)
-Add product reviews


12/6 Add to Backend - Michael:
--------------------------------------

 - Added a bunch of endpoints for managing the cart and books. Changes made
 to carts.js and server.js. It would be nice to split the server file up, it's
 getting long and convoluted

BOOKS:

 - GET /api/books - gets all of the books
 - GET /api/books/:isbn - Get single book
 - POST /api/books - Add new book (admin)
 - PUT /api/books/:isbn - Update book (admin)
 - DELETE /api/books/:isbn - Delete book (admin)

CART:

 - GET /api/cart/:userId - Get user's cart
 - POST /api/cart/:userId/add - Add book to cart (Body: { isbn, quantity })
 - PUT /api/cart/:userId/update - Update item quantity (Body: { isbn, quantity })
 - DELETE /api/cart/:userId/remove/:isbn - Remove item
 - DELETE /api/cart/:userId/clear - Clear cart
 - GET /api/cart/:userId/total - Get cart totals

Added seed.js file (populates database with sample data (useful for testing))
